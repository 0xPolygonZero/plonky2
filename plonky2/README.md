# Plonky2

Plonky2 is a SNARK implementation based on techniques from PLONK and FRI. It is the successor of [Plonky](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky), which was based on PLONK and Halo.

Plonky2 is built for speed, and features a highly efficient recursive circuit. On a Macbook Pro, recursive proofs can be generated in about 170 ms.
