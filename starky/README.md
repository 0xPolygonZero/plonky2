# Starky

Starky is a FRI-based STARK implementation.

It is built for speed, features highly efficient recursive verification through `plonky2` circuits and gadgets, and is
being used as backend proving system for the Polygon Zero Type-1 zkEVM.

## Note on Zero-Knowledgeness

While STARKs can be made Zero-Knowledge, the primary purpose of `starky` is to provide fast STARK proof generation. As such,
ZK is disabled by default on `starky`. Applications requiring their proof to be `zero-knowledge` would need to apply a
recursive wrapper on top of their STARK proof with the `zero_knowledge` parameter activated in their `CircuitConfig`.
See `plonky2` documentation for more info.
